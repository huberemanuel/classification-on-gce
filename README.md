# classification-on-gce
Create a Machine Learning classifier to be deployed automatically on GCE

## Requirements

You will need a Google Cloud Project and permission to the [Artifact Registry API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=artifactregistry.googleapis.com).

## Web interface

The web interface was totally inspired by [imadeh](https://github.com/imadelh/ML-web-app) with code changes to use Tensorflow (instead of Pytorch) and FastAPI (instead of Flask).
